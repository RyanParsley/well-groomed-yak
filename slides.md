Beyond the realm of standard Integrated Development Environments, this presentation uncovers hidden gems like shell scripts and multiplexers, proving that sometimes, the best solutions aren't the most obvious ones. We'll explore how simple tools can turn repetitive tasks into quick wins, saving time and sanity. This isn't just about new tools; it's about rethinking how we approach those pesky, recurring coding problems. Discover how stepping outside the IDE can lead to smarter, more efficient coding practices.
